# Codex-Deployer Handbook

*Git-driven deployment companion for Swift services.*

## Abstract
Codex-Deployer unifies builds, logs, and semantic fixes in a single Git-bound loop. It primarily runs `deploy/dispatcher_v2.py` to build the local **FountainAI** sources vendored under `repos/`. The project began as a pragmatic helper for Codex but ultimately clears the path for FountainAI, a platform where large language models orchestrate tools, analyse knowledge drift, and learn from reflection. As the deployment loop compiles and patches code, it mirrors FountainAI's broader reasoning flow, where plans are executed step by step and every outcome informs the next iteration.

## Quick start
Clone the repository, copy the sample environment file, and start the dispatcher in Docker.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fountain-coach/codex-deployer /srv/deploy
cd /srv/deploy
cp systemd/dispatcher.env dispatcher.env  # edit values
export $(grep -v '^#' dispatcher.env | xargs)
docker build -t codex-deployer-local .
docker run --rm -it \
  -v $(pwd):/srv/deploy \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -e GITHUB_TOKEN -e OPENAI_API_KEY \
  codex-deployer-local \
  python3 /srv/deploy/deploy/dispatcher_v2.py
```
For an explanation of each variable and how to generate tokens, see the [setup guide](docs/managing_environment_variables.md).

## From Codex to FountainAI
Codex-Deployer focuses on deployment. For an overview of the broader FountainAI platform and its APIs, see [docs/future_vision.md](docs/future_vision.md).
