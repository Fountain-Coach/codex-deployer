# Codex-Deployer Handbook

*Git-driven deployment companion for Swift services.*

## Abstract
Codex-Deployer unifies builds, logs, and semantic fixes in a single Git-bound loop. The project began as a pragmatic helper for Codex, but it ultimately clears the path for **FountainAI**, a platform where large language models orchestrate tools, analyse knowledge drift, and learn from reflection. As the deployment loop compiles and patches code, it mirrors FountainAI's broader reasoning flow, where plans are executed step by step and every outcome informs the next iteration.

## Quick start
Clone the repository, copy the sample environment file, and start the dispatcher in Docker.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fountain-coach/codex-deployer /srv/deploy
cd /srv/deploy
cp systemd/dispatcher.env dispatcher.env  # edit values
export $(grep -v '^#' dispatcher.env | xargs)
docker build -t codex-deployer-local .
docker run --rm -it \
  -v $(pwd):/srv/deploy \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -e GITHUB_TOKEN -e OPENAI_API_KEY \
  codex-deployer-local \
  python3 /srv/deploy/deploy/dispatcher_v2.py
```
For an explanation of each variable and how to generate tokens, see the [setup guide](docs/managing_environment_variables.md).

## From Codex to FountainAI
The dispatcher acts as a **semantic compiler**, applying patches and rebuilding until services succeed. FountainAI takes this approach further. According to the platform overview, it "combines large language models with a suite of specialized services to enable advanced AI reasoning, planning, and knowledge management." Tools are registered, called, and reflected upon so that the AI can improve over time. Our build loop foreshadows that design: after each cycle, the log is parsed, fixes are applied, and the next iteration begins. FountainAI generalizes this idea by orchestrating plans, invoking tools, and storing reflections in corpora, producing "structured multi-step planning" and "automated reflection" for continuous improvement.

Although this repository centers on deployment, the greater vision is an orchestration engine where plans, roles and reflections continually refine the agent's behaviour. For a full introduction, see the [FountainAI Platform Overview PDF](repos/fountainai/Docs/FountainAI%20Platform%20Overview.pdf).

FountainAI aims to unify these services under a persistent reasoning loop that stores knowledge and reflections for long‚Äëterm improvement. This repository is just one piece of that puzzle.
