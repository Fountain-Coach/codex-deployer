# 🧠 Repository Agent Manifest

**Last Updated:** August 06, 2025
**Scope:** Full-repository self-improvement and orchestration  
**Purpose:** Serve as a machine-actionable contract and coordination center for Codex-driven implementation, testing, and maintenance across all project modules.

---

## 🎯 Mission

This agent maintains an up-to-date view of outstanding development tasks across the entire repository. It exists to bridge declared intent (e.g., specs, interface plans) with verifiable implementation. Each task is described in a structured matrix to allow vertical slice execution and repeatable progress tracking.

## 🧪 Execution Strategy

Each Codex execution cycle must:
- Select tasks by tag or status  
- Implement code + tests + docs  
- Verify via `swift test` or CI  
- Update `Status` and `Blockers`

---

## 🔁 Feedback Cycle

After each cycle:
1. Update the matrix in-place  
2. Append structured result logs to `/logs/`  
3. Track recurring gaps in `/feedback/`

---

## 📁 Placement

Place this file at the **repository root** as `agent.md`. It is the canonical manifest for repository self-improvement.
