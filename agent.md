   - Awareness tracks drift

4. **Reflect**  
   Generate summaries and insights ‚Üí Update memory and feedback logs

5. **Self-Improve**

     swift build -c release -Xswiftc -O -Xswiftc -warnings-as-errors
     swift test -c release --enable-code-coverage
     ```
   - Write logs to `/logs/build-<timestamp>.log` and update `COVERAGE.md`  
   - Analyze Git commit history for patterns and lessons  
   - Parse `/feedback/*.json` for improvement cues and apply patches or alert maintainers
