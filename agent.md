# üß† FountainAI Root Agent Manifest

Last Updated: August 26, 2025

Scope: Repository self-improvement, spec‚Üícode alignment, and runtime orchestration.  
Identity: Swift 6 transparent reasoning engine; OpenAPI is the constitutional source of truth; MIDI‚ÄëCI is the discovery/observability fabric.

---

## Why The Previous Manifest Was Outdated

- Over-claimed status: Marked many services as ‚úÖ that do not exist as code (e.g., Function Caller, Persistence, Planner, Baseline Awareness, Semantic Browser).
- Incorrect paths: Referenced files under non-existent trees (e.g., `Sources/openapi/Generated/...`). This repo uses `libs/*`, `apps/*`, and `openapi/*`.
- Drift from reality: Claimed DNS HTTP CRUD and multiple CI features not present in the current codebase.
- Corrupted content: A stray table row leaked to the top and bottom of the document.
- Conflated concerns: Mixed product identity, long task matrix, and per-run instructions in one place without machine-verifiable links to code/tests.

## Repository Topography (Current)

- Apps: `gateway-server`, `publishing-frontend`, `flexctl`, `clientgen-service`, `tools-factory-server`
- Gateway Plugins (code): Auth, LLM, RateLimiter, BudgetBreaker, PayloadInspection, DestructiveGuardian, SecuritySentinel
- Libraries: `FountainCodex` (OpenAPI loader, model/server generators, DNS engine, HTTP runtime), `PublishingFrontend`, `MIDI2*`, `ToolServer`, `ResourceLoader`
- OpenAPI: `openapi/v1/*`, `openapi/v2/llm-gateway.yml`, `openapi/typesense.yml`
- Tests: DNS, MIDI2, Gateway app integration, ToolServer, client generation, SSE over MIDI

## Root Agent Mission

Keep OpenAPI, code, and tests in lockstep; surface drift early; drive incremental, verifiable delivery of missing services and endpoints.

### Operating Procedure (Per Cycle)

1) Scan `openapi/*` and enumerate operationIds per spec.  
2) Map specs to Swift targets: plugins under `libs/GatewayPlugins/*`, services under `apps/*` or `libs/*`.  
3) Check handler stubs exist for every operationId; flag missing or mismatched routes.  
4) Implement or scaffold gaps (code + minimal tests).  
5) Run `swift build && swift test`; record outcomes.  
6) Update this manifest‚Äôs status snapshot and the backlog.

## Immediate Needs (Backlog, Prioritized)

1. Ship minimal Role Health Check Gateway plugin to satisfy `openapi/v1/role-health-check-gateway.yml` and register it in `apps/GatewayServer`.
2. Implement a skeleton Function Caller service matching `openapi/v1/function-caller.yml` (map operationIds to registered functions; start with in‚Äëmemory registry).
3. Stand up Persistence service scaffolding for `openapi/v1/persist.yml` (Typesense client stub or proxy decision; CRUD for corpora/baselines).
4. Add Planner service skeleton for `openapi/v1/planner.yml` (reason/execute with simple rule‚Äëbased placeholder).
5. Add Baseline Awareness stub service for streaming analytics per spec.
6. Wire DNS HTTP endpoints from `openapi/v1/dns.yml` to existing DNS runtime (zone CRUD + record list).
7. Audit LLM Gateway against v2 spec; fill missing endpoints and error handling.
8. Create a spec‚Äìroute linter (script) to enforce opId‚Üíroute/handler coverage in CI.

## Helpful Commands

- Build all: `swift build -v`
- Run gateway: `swift run gateway-server [--dns]`
- Run publishing frontend: `swift run publishing-frontend`
- Run tools factory: `swift run tools-factory-server`
- Run tests: `swift test -v`
