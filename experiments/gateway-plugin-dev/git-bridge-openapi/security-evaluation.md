# Security Evaluation

The following measures outline a security-audited sandbox for the Git Bridge API:

1. **Containerized Repositories** – isolate each repository in its own sandboxed environment with restricted filesystem and network access.
2. **Input Sanitization** – validate and normalize all paths, enforce size limits on uploads, and prevent traversal or symlink attacks.
3. **Authentication & Authorization** – require bearer tokens or mutual TLS and apply per-repository access controls.
4. **Audit Logging** – record every mutation with user identity, timestamp, IP, and request payload hash. Expose logs through a dedicated endpoint.
5. **Static & Dynamic Scanning** – run secret and malware scanners on uploads and provide scan reports through the API.
6. **Policy Enforcement** – evaluate custom policies before accepting operations and reject non-compliant requests.
7. **Rate Limiting & Quotas** – prevent abuse with token/IP rate limits and track resource quotas.
8. **Immutable Audit Storage** – ship logs to write-once storage and consider cryptographic signing for integrity.
9. **Versioned Configurations** – store sandbox and policy configuration in Git for transparency and rollback.
