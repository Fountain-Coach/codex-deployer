# Kong Use Case Scenarios

The FountainAI microservices expose OpenAPI-based endpoints that can be unified behind Kong. Below are illustrative scenarios that build upon the features described in [kong_pitch.md](kong_pitch.md).

1. **Multi-Tenant API Portal** – A custom onboarding plugin could create isolated workspaces in the Persistence service while registering keys via Kong's authentication plugins. This lets developers self-serve access with per-tenant rate limits.
2. **Versioned Tool Chains** – Kong can direct clients to the correct version of function definitions registered in Tools Factory. Older clients keep working while new versions roll out transparently.
3. **Adaptive Rate Limiting for LLM Gateway** – Plugins can inspect request payloads and apply stricter quotas to complex prompts or function chains, protecting compute budgets.
4. **Event-Driven Reflection** – Kong may capture Planner and Function Caller interactions and forward metrics to the Awareness service for real-time dashboards.
5. **Live Debug Proxy** – During development, a debug mode could forward internal headers between microservices, helping trace full workflows from Bootstrap to Planner.
6. **WebSocket-Backed Tool Execution** – If FountainAI introduces streaming or asynchronous tools, Kong's WebSocket support can proxy those connections while still applying auth and rate limits.
7. **Declarative Configuration with CI/CD** – Gateway configuration stored under version control can be rolled out automatically as part of the deployer loop. Any environment variables for this process are documented in [docs/environment_variables.md](../docs/environment_variables.md).

These scenarios show how Kong becomes more than a simple router—it orchestrates versioning, tenant management, observability and real-time tooling around FountainAI's services.
