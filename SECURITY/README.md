# Risk Evaluation

## Unauthorized Access / Privilege Escalation
**Risk:** APIs controlling gateways, DNS, and model servers can be abused to alter configurations, reroute traffic, or delete data if authentication and authorization are weak.  
**Impact:** Service outages, compromised user data, or loss of critical configurations.

## Destructive Memory or Data Operations
**Risk:** A misconfigured or malicious request could invoke API endpoints that delete logs, caches, or storage, including model weights or configuration files.  
**Impact:** Loss of model state, historical records, or inability to recover from failures.

## Model Misuse / Prompt Injection
**Risk:** Attackers could craft prompts that cause the LLM to produce harmful instructions or expose secrets.  
**Impact:** Accidental compliance with destructive actions, data leakage, or reputational damage.

## Denial of Service (DoS) & Resource Exhaustion
**Risk:** Intentionally crafted queries or continuous automated calls can overload the system.  
**Impact:** Degraded service availability, increased latency, and potential outages.

## Insecure Dependency or Deployment Pipeline
**Risk:** Infected containers, outdated libraries, or poorly handled secrets can be exploited to gain control of the infrastructure.  
**Impact:** Attackers executing arbitrary code or tampering with deployment artifacts.

# Risk Mitigation & Recommendations

## Strengthen Access Controls
- Use OAuth2 or similar authentication and enforce fine-grained authorization.  
- Segregate permissions so an LLM or service can only access necessary endpoints.  
- Implement rate limiting to reduce brute-force risks.  

## Harden Memory and Data Management
- Restrict destructive API endpoints (delete, modify) to internal services or human approval workflows.  
- Use write-once logs and regular snapshots/backups of model data, so even if deletion occurs, it can be restored.  
- Monitor for anomalous deletion requests.  

## Enforce Input Filtering & Policy Checking
- Deploy prompt/response validators to detect malicious patterns or attempts to manipulate the LLM into executing harmful tasks.  
- Set explicit security policies for the LLM to refuse or flag dangerous instructions.  
- Keep partial and sanitized contextâ€”avoid storing sensitive or user-identifiable data in prompts.  

## Resilience against DoS
- Introduce load balancing, autoscaling, and traffic throttling.  
- Maintain out-of-band health checks and failover paths for critical services.  
- Implement circuit breakers or request budgets per user/service.  

## Secure the Supply Chain and Runtime
- Verify container images with signed checksums and use dependency scanning tools.  
- Apply patches promptly and keep infrastructure as code under version control.  
- Isolate the model runtime (e.g., in sandboxed environments) so any compromise remains contained.

By combining robust authentication, tightly scoped permissions, strong monitoring, and defense-in-depth practices, the LLM and its surrounding infrastructure can be prevented from performing destructive actions and kept resilient against malicious misuse or accidental harm.
