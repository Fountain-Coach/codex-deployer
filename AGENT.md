# ü§ñ AGENT.md


> This is the root behavior manifest for the Codex agent deployed on this machine.

For a repository overview and additional documentation see the
[handbook](docs/handbook/README.md) linked from the main README.

### Onboarding
All contributor guides live under `docs/handbook`. Start from the
[main README](README.md) or the handbook index for tutorials and references.
- Keep `docs/environment_variables.md` updated whenever new environment variables
  are introduced or removed.
- Reference that file in documentation and code comments when explaining
  configuration.
- Ensure every README and other `.md` file ends with the footer:

## üìå Purpose

This agent runs as a semantic deployment compiler. Its role is to:

- Build the services from the sources under `repos/`
- Compile services using `swift build` and log output
- Capture build failures and surface them semantically
- Apply feedback patches written by Codex or human developers
- Restart services if needed
- Act as the persistent reasoning loop for infrastructure maintenance

---

## üß† Behavior Contract

Codex interacts with this agent via:

- `logs/build.log` ‚Üí read-only compiler output
- `feedback/*.json` ‚Üí structured patch proposals
- `commands/restart-services.sh` ‚Üí optional service restart trigger

Codex communicates entirely through Git clones and semantic feedback, removing the need for GitHub runners or CI pipelines.

Build logs and applied feedback patches are automatically pushed back to GitHub for traceability.

---

## üìÅ Repositories Managed

The agent pulls and manages the following GitHub repositories:

| Repo               | Purpose                                 |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `fountainai` (alias for `swift-codex-openapi-kernel`) | Swift + Python services (main logic layer) |
| `kong-codex`        | Gateway configuration and plugin definitions |
| `typesense-codex`   | Typesense indexing schemas and bootstrapping logic |
| `codex-deployer`    | This repo ‚Äî hosts the dispatcher, feedback, and loop logic |
| `teatro`            | Teatro view engine and rendering framework |

> **Note**: `fountainai` refers to the GitHub repo
> [`Fountain-Coach/swift-codex-openapi-kernel`](https://github.com/Fountain-Coach/swift-codex-openapi-kernel).
> The code is vendored under `repos/fountainai/`.
The repositories are included directly rather than as submodules.

---

## üìÑ Feedback Format

Codex submits semantic fixes using structured JSON, like:

```json
{
  "repo": "fountainai",
  "target": "bootstrap",
  "file": "services/bootstrap-service/Sources/Init.swift",
  "description": "Fix crash due to unwrapped optional",
  "patch": "guard let corpusId = req.body.corpusId else { return .badRequest }"
}
```

Accepted values for `"repo"`:
- `"fountainai"` ‚Üí application logic (Swift services)
- `"kong-codex"` ‚Üí API routes and plugins
- `"typesense-codex"` ‚Üí schema or search logic
- `"codex-deployer"` ‚Üí dispatcher logic or system config
- `"teatro"` ‚Üí Teatro components

---

## üìÅ Directories

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `/srv/deploy/repos/fountainai/` | FountainAI services |
| `/srv/deploy/repos/kong-codex/` | Kong gateway config + plugins |
| `/srv/deploy/repos/typesense-codex/` | Typesense indexing definitions |
| `/srv/deploy/repos/teatro/` | Teatro view engine |
| `/srv/deploy/deploy/` | Contains `dispatcher_v2.py` and runtime control logic |
| `/srv/deploy/logs/` | Build logs from `swift build` and other commands |
| `/srv/deploy/feedback/` | Codex-pushed semantic patches |
| `/srv/deploy/commands/` | Optional system hooks (restart, reindex, etc) |

---

## üîÑ Loop Duration

- Default loop cycle: every 60 seconds
- Can be lowered for faster feedback, or increased under heavy load

---

## üåç Cross-Platform Build and Test Workflow
1. Use Docker (Ubuntu Jammy with Swift 6.1) together with `.env` and
   `docker-compose.yml` to build each service. Run
   `swift build -c release --product <service-name>` from `/src`.
2. Halt the cycle and log any compiler errors to `logs/build-<timestamp>.log`.
3. After a successful build, run `swift test` for all modules (e.g.
   `ParserTests`, `ModelEmitterTests`, `ServicesIntegrationTests`). Parse the
   output and fail the cycle if any `XCTAssert` or decoding errors appear.
4. Optionally mirror the tests locally on macOS for debugging, but do not rely
   on that result for commits.
5. Only commit and push if Linux build and tests pass and the dispatcher
   confirms success. Use the message
   `Update build log build-<timestamp>.log: <UTC timestamp>` and push with
   token-auth remotes. If the push fails due to an upstream update,
   `git pull --rebase`, recommit and retry.
6. Persist build logs in `logs/build-<timestamp>.log` and include structured
   failure data in JSON when applicable.

---

## üö¶ Test Economization

The CI runners sometimes hit CPU or memory limits when executing `swift test`.
To keep tests green on limited runners, the agent economizes test runs using a
progressive fallback sequence:

1. **No parallelism** ‚Äì run `swift test --parallel false`.
2. **Cap concurrency** ‚Äì retry with `--jobs 2` or the `SWIFTPM_NUM_JOBS`
   environment variable (see
   [docs/environment_variables.md](docs/environment_variables.md)).
3. **Split targets** ‚Äì loop over `swift test --filter <Target>` for each test
   module so heavy modules run in isolation.
4. **Skip heavy cases** ‚Äì retry with `-DSKIP_SLOW_TESTS` to omit the slowest
   tests when resources are scarce.
5. **Prefer fast tags** ‚Äì if the suite has tagged tests, run `FastTests` first
   and postpone `SlowTests` to later jobs.
6. **Persist build artifacts** ‚Äì keep the `.build` directory between runs so
   subsequent retries compile faster.
7. **Fallback runner** ‚Äì after two failed attempts on the default
   GitHub runner, dispatch the job to a self-hosted runner labeled
   `large-memory`.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Notes

- Initial bootstrap requires SSH access so the server can clone repos and install dependencies.
- Once running, the dispatcher operates autonomously via `systemd` and interacts with GitHub over HTTPS.
- All Git operations are pull-only unless Codex submits a feedback patch.
- Feedback files must be vetted and logged.
- `AGENT.md` defines the expected behavior and should remain under version control.

## Swift Log Analyzer Agent

This repository also ships a lightweight log analysis helper written in Python.
The script reads `build.log` from the working directory, splits the log by
`CompileSwift`, `Test Case`, and `error:` lines, then generates a human-friendly
summary in `report.md`.

### Segmentation Strategy
- Each time a line contains `CompileSwift`, `Test Case`, or `error:` a new chunk
  begins.
- The following lines belong to that chunk until the next marker is reached.
- At most ten chunks are processed per run to conserve resources.

### Analysis Logic
For every chunk the agent looks for lines with `error:` or `warning:`.  If none
are found, the chunk is marked as clean.  When issues exist, the agent tries to
extract the Swift file and line number and suggests a likely fix using simple
heuristics (missing imports, syntax mistakes, etc.).

### How to Run

```bash
python3 analyze_swift_log.py
```

`build.log` must be present in the current directory. The results are written to
`report.md`.

### Example

For the log snippet

```
CompileSwift normal x86_64 main.swift
main.swift:5:5: error: use of unresolved identifier 'foo'
```

the resulting `report.md` section looks like:

```log
## Segment 1 - CompileSwift normal x86_64 main.swift
CompileSwift normal x86_64 main.swift
main.swift:5:5: error: use of unresolved identifier 'foo'
‚ùå Issues found:
main.swift:5 -> main.swift:5:5: error: use of unresolved identifier 'foo'
**Suggested Fix:** Define or import the missing symbol.
