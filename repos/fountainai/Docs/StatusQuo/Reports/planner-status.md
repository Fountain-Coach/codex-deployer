# Planner Service ‚Äì Implementation Status

## Overview
The Planner orchestrates LLM-driven workflows across the LLM Gateway and Function Caller.
Spec path: `FountainAi/openAPI/v1/planner.yml` (version 1.0.0).

## Implementation State
- OpenAPI operations defined: 6
- Generated client SDK at `Generated/Client/planner`
- Generated server kernel at `Generated/Server/planner`
- Router and handlers orchestrate workflows via `LLMGatewayClient` and `FunctionCallerClient`
- Integration tests cover the `planner_list_corpora`, `planner_reason` and `planner_execute` endpoints
- Prometheus metrics exposed at `/metrics`
- Authentication middleware checks the `PLANNER_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable
- Configuration variables `LLM_GATEWAY_URL` and `FUNCTION_CALLER_URL` are listed in [environment_variables.md](../../../../../docs/environment_variables.md)
- Structured logging captures workflow steps
- Docker Compose example ties the Planner to the Gateway and Function Caller

## Recent Updates
- Added end-to-end integration tests covering planning workflows
- Structured logging now records every planned step

## Next Steps toward Production
- API upgraded to stable v1 and request/response models are locked
- **Completed**: Implemented full workflow orchestration calling the LLM Gateway and Function Caller
- Document environment variables and external dependencies
- Refer to [environment_variables.md](../../../../../docs/environment_variables.md) when configuring the service
