# Production Readiness Summary

All FountainAI services now run using a shared Swift concurrency runtime. Integration tests cover cross‑service workflows against a real Typesense instance and the LLM Gateway proxies requests to OpenAI.

## Component Overview
- **Baseline Awareness** – persists baselines and streams analytics via SSE.
- **Bootstrap** – initializes corpora and seeds default roles with Prometheus metrics.
- **Function Caller** – dispatches registered functions with disk‑backed caching.
- **LLM Gateway** – forwards chat completions to OpenAI using typed models.
- **Planner** – orchestrates workflow execution across the LLM Gateway and Function Caller.
- **Tools Factory** – registers tool definitions and validates OpenAPI documents.
- **Persistence** – stores corpora and tool data in Typesense.

## Path to Production
1. **Finalize APIs and versioning** – Planner upgraded to stable v1 and request/response models are locked across services.
2. **Expand integration tests** – exercise complete workflows via Docker Compose and CI.
3. **Containerize and deploy** – publish images and create Kubernetes manifests for every service.
4. **Monitor and log** – standardize Prometheus metrics and aggregate logs across the suite.
5. **Document configuration** – reference required environment variables in [environment_variables.md](../../../../../docs/environment_variables.md) from all service documentation.

Completing these steps will transition FountainAI from prototype status to a stable, production‑ready microservice suite.
