# LLM Gateway Service ‚Äì Implementation Status

## Overview
The LLM Gateway proxies requests to any large language model with function-calling support.
Spec path: `FountainAi/openAPI/v2/llm-gateway.yml` (version 2.0.0).

## Implementation State
- OpenAPI operations defined: 2
- Generated client SDK at `Generated/Client/llm-gateway`
- Generated server kernel at `Generated/Server/llm-gateway`
- Minimal socket runtime handles `/chat` and `/metrics`; Prometheus records request counts
- Client decodes typed models
- The `/chat` endpoint forwards requests to OpenAI's Chat Completions API
- Requests to OpenAI use `OPENAI_API_KEY` for authentication and can be routed through `OPENAI_API_BASE`
- Environment variables are documented in [environment_variables.md](../../../../../docs/environment_variables.md)
- Structured logging outputs JSON records
- Docker Compose example runs the gateway with the Planner and Function Caller

## Recent Updates
- Initial chat proxy implemented using `URLSession`
- Prometheus metrics integrated with the simple runtime
- Integration tests verify the `/metrics` endpoint

## Next Steps toward Production
- **Completed**: Basic connection to OpenAI via `URLSession`
- Expand metrics to track request durations and success/failure counts
- Add integration tests for the `/chat` endpoint
- Provide Docker build and deployment instructions
- Document `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_BASE` usage in [environment_variables.md](../../../../../docs/environment_variables.md)
