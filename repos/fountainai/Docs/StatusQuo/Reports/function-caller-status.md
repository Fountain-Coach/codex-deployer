# Function Caller Service ‚Äì Implementation Status

## Overview
The Function Caller maps OpenAI function-calling plans to HTTP operations using definitions from the Tools Factory.
Spec path: `FountainAi/openAPI/v1/function-caller.yml` (version 1.0.0).

## Implementation State
- OpenAPI operations defined: 3
- Generated client SDK at `Generated/Client/function-caller`
- Generated server kernel at `Generated/Server/function-caller`
- Handlers dispatch registered functions via ``FunctionDispatcher`` using ``TypesenseClient``
- Client decodes typed models for all endpoints
- When `TYPESENSE_URL` is set the dispatcher persists and retrieves functions from the external Typesense service so definitions survive restarts
- See [environment_variables.md](../../../../../docs/environment_variables.md) for required configuration.
- Authentication middleware checks the `FUNCTION_CALLER_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable
- Integration tests verify the `list_functions` endpoint and invocation flows
- Tools Factory integration allows dynamic registration via `/tools/register`
- Dispatcher reports errors with structured JSON responses
- Prometheus metrics available at `/metrics`
- Invocation parameters validated against stored JSON Schemas
- Structured logging records each request as JSON
- Per-endpoint metrics now include request durations
- Invocation success and failure counts tracked via Prometheus
- Function definitions cached to disk via `FUNCTIONS_CACHE_PATH`
- Docker Compose example at `Docs/Compose/function-caller-tools.yml`
- Invocation logs can be streamed via SSE for debugging

## Recent Updates
- Log aggregation setup documented in [log_aggregation.md](../../../../../docs/log_aggregation.md)
- Added SSE support for real-time invocation logs

## Next Steps toward Production
- Harden cache invalidation and error handling
- Expand integration tests for the Compose workflow
- **Completed**: Registered functions persist across restarts via Typesense integration
- Document Kubernetes deployment examples
- See [next-steps.md](next-steps.md) for cross-service priorities
