# Baseline Awareness Service â€“ Implementation Status

## Overview
FountainAI Baseline Awareness manages baselines, drift, patterns, reflections and semantic analytics.
Spec path: `FountainAi/openAPI/v1/baseline-awareness.yml` (version 1.0.0).

## Implementation State
- OpenAPI operations defined: **11** covering corpus initialization, baseline and drift ingestion, pattern storage, reflection management and analytics queries
- Generated client SDK at `Generated/Client/baseline-awareness` now encodes request bodies and decodes typed responses
- Generated server kernel at `Generated/Server/baseline-awareness` now includes `main.swift` with a simple socket runtime that parses headers and bodies
- Router decodes JSON bodies into models and forwards them to ``BaselineStore`` backed by the in-memory ``TypesenseClient``
- All operations are implemented and `/health` returns a structured JSON status
- A `Dockerfile` builds the service binary, and build/run instructions appear in the repository README
- Integration tests verify `/health`, corpus initialization and baseline ingestion
- When `TYPESENSE_URL` and `TYPESENSE_API_KEY` are set the service persists data in an external Typesense instance; otherwise it falls back to the in-memory store.
- The `BaselineStore` persists via `TypesenseClient`, sharing the persistence service infrastructure
- Expanded documentation describes building and running the service container and verifying `/health`
- CI workflow runs integration tests on both Linux and macOS using `AsyncHTTPClient` and the NIO server
- Integration tests run the NIO-based server on both Linux and macOS for cross-platform coverage
## Next Steps toward Production
- Implement production analytics on top of the persistence layer and add authentication middleware
