# üé¨ Proposal: Hijacking a Screenplay Editor for FountainAI Orchestration

## üéØ Objective

To reimagine the primary GUI of the FountainAI platform as a screenplay-style editor based on the `.fountain` markup language ‚Äî treating LLM roles as **cast members**, tool calls as **actions**, and reasoning flows as a structured **narrative**. This metaphor aligns naturally with FountainAI‚Äôs architecture and enables a human-readable, semantically traceable interface for LLM orchestration, planning, and self-reflection.

---

## üß© Rationale

FountainAI is a modular platform that combines LLM-based reasoning, external function orchestration, semantic memory, and drift tracking into a unified system. Its core entities ‚Äî such as **corpora**, **baselines**, **roles**, **reflections**, and **tool invocations** ‚Äî can be intuitively mapped onto elements from screenplay writing:

| FountainAI Concept     | Screenplay Metaphor             |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| GPT Role               | Character                        |
| Corpus / Context       | Scene Header                     |
| Tool Invocation        | Action Block / Beat              |
| Function Output        | Dialogue or Live SSE Stream      |
| Reflection             | Voice-Over or Internal Monologue |
| Drift or Change        | Scene Transition (`CUT TO:`)     |
| Semantic Arc           | Plotline or Story Summary        |

This metaphor is not a skin-deep gimmick ‚Äî it faithfully models the actual architecture of FountainAI and supports both **human authorship** and **LLM improvisation** in a readable and reversible format.

## üß™ Proof of Concept

Below is a semantically annotated `.fountain` screenplay adapted for the FountainAI platform:

```fountain
Title: "Baseline Initiation"
Credit: A FountainAI Orchestration
Date: July 22, 2025

#corpus: coaching-session-001

EXT. SEMANTIC GROUND ZERO ‚Äì INITIATION

> INPUT: "Client uploaded business summary for Q2."

> BASELINE:
"""
Q2 saw a 12% increase in customer churn compared to Q1. Sales plateaued despite higher ad spend. New onboarding flows were introduced mid-quarter.
"""

PLANNER (as ANALYST)
(to SYSTEM)
Let‚Äôs start with a drift and pattern check. Also promote any useful insight into a new GPT role.

> tool_call: /bootstrap/baseline

> SSE: drift.md
>>> "Customer satisfaction signals diverge from spending trends. Product friction is newly detected post-onboarding."

> SSE: patterns.md
>>> "Emerging narrative: Stability in sales masks early signs of disengagement. High friction theme clusters around onboarding."

REFLECT:
(to SELF)
What new role would help monitor this pattern in future?

> PROMOTE: Role: ONBOARDING-FRICTION-SCOUT

CUT TO:

INT. AI WORKSPACE ‚Äì MOMENTS LATER

CRITIC (voice-over)
(to SELF)
Did we ignore ad effectiveness data? It may be misleading the Planner.

> tool_call: /planner/reflections

SUMMARY:
- Baseline seeded.
- Drift and pattern detected.
- New role promoted for targeted monitoring.
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Syntax & Schema

- Define extended `.fountain` grammar for:
- `#corpus:` headers
- `> BASELINE:`, `> SSE:`, `> tool_call:` blocks
- `REFLECT:`, `PROMOTE:`, `SUMMARY:` tags

| Override Rule              | Status Quo Interpretation |
|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| `#corpus:`                 | Section heading (`#`)     |
| `> BASELINE:`              | Transition/Action         |
| `> SSE:`                   | Transition/Action         |
| `> tool_call:`             | Transition/Action         |
| `REFLECT:`                 | Action                    |
| `PROMOTE:`                 | Action                    |
| `SUMMARY:`                 | Action                    |

### Phase 2: Editor Integration
- Integrate `.fountain` editor into a single scrolling document.
- Each directive becomes a block rendered by `DirectiveBlockView`.
- Tool output is inserted inline so `viewModel.blocks` drives a `ForEach` loop.
- No right pane ‚Äì everything flows inside the script.
### Phase 3: Codex Integration

- Implement `.fountain` ‚Üí AST parser
- Drive Codex via screenplay intent:
  - Detect tool calls
  - Render roles from dialog
  - Reflect transitions into planning steps

### Phase 4: Live Streaming Support

- SSE support for drift and pattern outputs.
- Markdown/TeatroView live rendering of AI output blocks.

---

## üß† Benefits

- **Human-readable** semantic orchestration format.
- **Role-based reasoning** visualized as character dialog.
- **Narrative coherence** via reflections and semantic arcs.
- **Agent traceability** with minimal abstraction overhead.
- **Codex-friendly** format for editing, interpreting, and compiling into execution plans.
