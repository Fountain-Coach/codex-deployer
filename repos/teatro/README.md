*A Declarative, Codex-Controllable Rendering Framework in Swift*
This repository contains the specification for Teatro, a modular Swift 6 view engine. The original long-form documentation has been split into separate files under the `Docs` directory.
## Documentation

## Installation

Add the package to your Package.swift dependencies:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/fountain-coach/teatro.git", branch: "main")
```

Then include `Teatro` as a dependency in your target.

`TeatroSampler` provides cross-platform MIDI 2 playback for the animation player and bridges events to legacy formats when needed.

The new **Storyboard DSL** allows you to script view states and animated transitions in Swift.  See the guide for an example of generating a textual storyboard preview that can be sent back to Codex.

The `Sources/` directory follows the structure suggested in the documentation and contains placeholders for implementation. `Tests/` remains empty until concrete code is added.
