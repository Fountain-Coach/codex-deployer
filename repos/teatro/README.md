The new **Storyboard DSL** allows you to script view states and animated transitions in Swift.  See the guide for an example of generating a textual storyboard preview that can be sent back to Codex.

The `Sources/` directory follows the structure suggested in the documentation and contains placeholders for implementation. `Tests/` remains empty until concrete code is added.
