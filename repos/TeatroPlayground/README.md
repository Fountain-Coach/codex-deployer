# TeatroPlayground

TeatroPlayground acts as a macOS playground for the [Teatro](../teatro) view engine. It bundles the `TeatroPlaygroundUI` library together with a simple SwiftUI app so developers can experiment with Teatro-based UIs in a standalone environment.

## Building

Run the package with Swift Package Manager:

```bash
swift build
```

For live previews, open `ContentView.swift` in Xcode and use the SwiftUI preview canvas.
