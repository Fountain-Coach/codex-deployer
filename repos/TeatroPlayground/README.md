# TeatroPlayground – Official UX Playground for Teatro

TeatroPlayground is the official UX playground for the [Teatro](../teatro) view engine. It bundles the `TeatroPlaygroundUI` library with a simple SwiftUI app so you can prototype and test Teatro components in a standalone environment.

## Build and Run

Run the package with Swift Package Manager:

```bash
swift build
swift run TeatroPlayground
```

For live previews, open `ContentView.swift` in Xcode and use the SwiftUI preview canvas.
