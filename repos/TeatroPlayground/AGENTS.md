# Repository Guidelines

This repository contains **TeatroPlayground**, a macOS SwiftUI app for experimenting with the Teatro view engine.
Use it to prototype interfaces and validate UX ideas.

- Keep sample views simple and in sync with the protocols defined in the Teatro repo.
- Run `swift build` after changes to ensure the playground compiles.
