Values: right_to_left (default), left_to_right, both_sides:3 A note on both_sides:3 - for queries upto 3 tokens (words) in length, this mode will drop tokens from both sides and exhaustively rank all matching results. If query length is greater than 3 words, Typesense will just fallback to default behavior of right_to_left  */
