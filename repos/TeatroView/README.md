# TeatroView ‚Äì Typesense GUI

TeatroView is an experimental GUI for [Typesense](https://typesense.org) built with the [Teatro](../teatro) view engine. It demonstrates how Teatro renders SwiftUI scenes while providing a simple interface to manage and search a Typesense instance.

## Build and Run

Make sure the following environment variables are set so the app can reach your server:

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `TYPESENSE_URL` | Base URL for a running Typesense instance |
| `TYPESENSE_API_KEY` | API key used for requests |

```
export TYPESENSE_URL=http://localhost:8108
export TYPESENSE_API_KEY=xyz
swift run TeatroView
```

The app builds with Swift Package Manager. Open the package in Xcode for SwiftUI previews or run from the command line as shown above.

### Dependency Layout

`Package.swift` pulls in the [Teatro](https://github.com/fountain-coach/teatro) dependency via its Git URL. Swift Package Manager will fetch it automatically when building the package.

### Generating the Typesense Client

The Typesense API client used by TeatroView is generated from the OpenAPI spec vendored in the monorepo. Run the script below whenever `repos/typesense-codex/openapi/openapi.yml` changes:

```bash
scripts/generate_typesense_client.sh
```

This script builds the custom Swift¬†6 generator from `repos/fountainai` and emits the sources under `Sources/TypesenseClient`.

## Contributing

This project lives in the `TeatroView` directory of the `codex-deployer` monorepo. Issues and pull requests are welcome. Please keep the README updated if you change build steps or environment variables. Refer to `docs/environment_variables.md` for the full list of variables used across the project.
