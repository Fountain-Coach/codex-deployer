# ðŸ¤– agent.md

This agent manages Kong routing, plugins and ensures the bundled Typesense
instance remains reachable.
Kong runs in db-less mode using `kong.yaml` as the declarative config.

Use `docker-compose.yml` for local testing. Update `docs/environment_variables.md`
when introducing new configuration.
