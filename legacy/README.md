# Legacy Documentation

This directory contains **deprecated** launch instructions, old Python scripts, and the former systemd setup.  These materials are kept only for historical reference.  Modern deployments use the Swift-based `FountainAiLauncher` from the repository root.

Notable subfolders:

- `systemd/` – legacy unit files and `dispatcher.env` sample
- `utils/` – Python dispatcher scripts and helper utilities
- `docs/` – environment variable reference and macOS Docker tutorials

The main documentation now lives in the root README and `FountainAiLauncher`.
