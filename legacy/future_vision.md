# FountainAI Future Vision

The dispatcher acts as a **semantic compiler**, applying patches and rebuilding until services succeed. FountainAI takes this approach further. According to the platform overview, it "combines large language models with a suite of specialized services to enable advanced AI reasoning, planning, and knowledge management." Tools are registered, called, and reflected upon so that the AI can improve over time. Our build loop foreshadows that design: after each cycle, the log is parsed, fixes are applied, and the next iteration begins. FountainAI generalizes this idea by orchestrating plans, invoking tools, and storing reflections in corpora, producing "structured multi-step planning" and "automated reflection" for continuous improvement.

Although this repository centers on deployment, the greater vision is an orchestration engine where plans, roles and reflections continually refine the agent's behaviour. For a full introduction, see the [FountainAI Platform Overview PDF](../repos/fountainai/Docs/FountainAI%20Platform%20Overview.pdf).

FountainAI aims to unify these services under a persistent reasoning loop that stores knowledge and reflections for long‚Äëterm improvement. This repository is just one piece of that puzzle.
