# Design Pattern Evaluation

This document summarizes the architectural patterns used across the Codex-powered deployment system.

## Managed Repositories

| Repository | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `fountainai` (alias for `swift-codex-openapi-kernel`) | Swift and Python services providing the main logic layer |
| `kong-codex` | Gateway configuration and plugin definitions |
| `seeding` | Typesense indexing schemas and bootstrapping logic |
| `codex-deployer` | Dispatcher loop, feedback handling, and deployment logic |
| `teatro` | Teatro view engine and rendering framework |

## Kernel – Client/Server Pattern

The kernel repository exposes services that clients consume over API boundaries.

**Strengths**
- Clear separation between server implementations and clients
- Scales horizontally as clients connect to a shared server

**Weaknesses**
- Each cross-service call adds network overhead
- Requires careful API versioning to avoid tight coupling

## Gateway – Plugin Pattern

The Kong gateway relies on plugins to handle routing, authentication, and other gateway features.

**Strengths**
- Modular behavior that can be extended or removed without rewriting the gateway
- Supports features like rate limiting and transformation through dedicated plugins

**Weaknesses**
- Managing many plugins can introduce complexity
- Each plugin must remain compatible with the gateway version

## View Engine – Declarative Style

Teatro defines its UI purely through declarations.

**Strengths**
- Predictable rendering with minimal side effects
- Easier to test individual view components

**Weaknesses**
- Highly dynamic interfaces can become verbose
- Debugging layout issues may require specialized tooling

## Overall Evaluation

The combination of a client/server kernel, plugin-driven gateway, and declarative view engine offers clear separation of concerns. While each pattern introduces trade-offs, the design aligns with common best practices and provides a solid foundation for scaling the system.
