## Plan for Security-Related Gateway Plugins

1. **Authentication & Authorization Plugin**  
   - Provide OAuth2-compatible authentication with fine-grained, role-based authorization to prevent abuse of gateway, DNS, or model server APIs

2. **Rate Limiting & Brute-Force Defense Plugin**  
   - Enforce per-identity rate limits and request throttling to curb privilege escalation attempts and resource exhaustion attacks

3. **Destructive Operation Guardian Plugin**  
   - Gate “delete/modify” endpoints behind internal services or manual approval, log all destructive actions, and flag anomalous deletion requests

4. **Prompt & Response Validation Plugin**  
   - Run incoming prompts and outgoing responses through validators that detect malicious patterns, enforce security policies, and strip sensitive data before storage

5. **Traffic Shaping & DoS Resilience Plugin**  
   - Combine load balancing, autoscaling hooks, per-user request budgets, and circuit breakers to sustain service availability under attack

6. **Supply-Chain Verification Plugin**  
   - Validate container image signatures, scan dependencies, and ensure patched, version-controlled artifacts before deployment; isolate runtime environments for defense in depth

These plugins collectively mitigate the risks outlined in the Security README by enforcing strong access controls, safeguarding data integrity, filtering hostile prompts, resisting DoS attacks, and securing the deployment pipeline.
