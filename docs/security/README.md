# FountainAi Security

This document outlines the current security posture of FountainAi and highlights controls that protect the gateway and related tooling.

## Threat Landscape
- **Unauthorized access or privilege escalation** ‚Äì Management APIs for gateways, DNS and model servers could be abused if authentication or role checks fail.
- **Destructive memory or data operations** ‚Äì Misconfigured or malicious requests may delete logs, caches or model weights.
- **Prompt injection or model misuse** ‚Äì Crafted prompts could cause the LLM to leak secrets or execute harmful instructions.
- **Denial of service & resource exhaustion** ‚Äì Continuous high‚Äëvolume calls can degrade availability.
- **Supply‚Äëchain or deployment compromise** ‚Äì Unsigned images or outdated libraries may allow code tampering.

## Current Controls
### Authentication & authorization
The authentication gateway plugin validates OAuth2/OIDC bearer tokens and enforces role‚Äëbased access on administrative routes, returning `401` or `403` when credentials or scopes are insufficient.

### Security sentinel
[`SecuritySentinelPlugin`](../../Sources/GatewayApp/SecuritySentinelPlugin.swift) inspects potentially destructive requests, consults an external `SecuritySentinel` service, logs decisions to `logs/security.log` and denies or escalates high‚Äërisk actions.

### Chain‚Äëof‚Äëthought logging
[`CoTLogger`](../../Sources/GatewayApp/CoTLogger.swift) captures reasoning when `include_cot` is set, sanitizes secrets, and optionally checks risky entries with the sentinel before persisting them.

### Rate limiting
[`RateLimiterPlugin`](../../Sources/GatewayApp/RateLimiterPlugin.swift) implements per‚Äëclient token buckets to throttle excessive requests and records allowance metrics.

### Pre‚Äëdeployment verification
[`Scripts/predeploy.sh`](../../Scripts/predeploy.sh) verifies container image signatures with Cosign, scans for high‚Äëseverity vulnerabilities via Grype, and generates an SBOM using Syft before release.

### Security Sentinel persona
The [LLM gateway safeguards](../../SECURITY/llm-gateway-safeguards.md) define a `SecuritySentinel` role that reviews high‚Äërisk instructions and returns `allow`, `deny`, or `escalate` decisions to the gateway.

## Roadmap & Gaps
The following recommendations remain pending:
- Write‚Äëonce logs, periodic snapshots, and anomaly monitoring for destructive operations.
- Prompt/response validation and policy enforcement for LLM interactions.
- Load balancing, autoscaling, circuit breakers, and per‚Äëuser request budgets.
- Signed container images, dependency scanning, and sandboxed runtimes.
