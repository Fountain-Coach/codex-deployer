# Developer Documentation

This directory collects generated documentation derived from inline `///` comments.
As modules gain documentation, brief summaries are added here.

## Current Highlights
- **PublishingFrontend** – lightweight static HTTP server for serving the `/Public` directory.
- **HTTPKernel** – simple asynchronous router used by the gateway and publishing frontend.
- **HetznerDNSClient** – Swift wrapper for the Hetzner DNS API with typed requests.
- **AsyncHTTPClientDriver** and **URLSessionHTTPClient** – documented HTTP clients powering network requests.
- **NIOHTTPServer** – documented server adapter built on SwiftNIO.

Documentation coverage will expand alongside test coverage.
