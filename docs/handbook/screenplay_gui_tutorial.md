# ScreenplayGUI Tutorial

*Modifying the preview app and injected blocks.*

ScreenplayGUI lives under `repos/fountainai/ScreenplayGUI`. Open this package in Xcode to experiment with fonts, layout, and script injection.

## Opening the package

1. Launch Xcode and choose **File ‚Üí Open**.
2. Navigate to `repos/fountainai/ScreenplayGUI` and select `Package.swift`.
3. Xcode indexes the package and exposes targets like `ScreenplayGUIApp` and `PreviewHost` for previews.

## Using SwiftUI previews

- Open `DirectiveBlockView.swift` or `ScreenplayMainStage.swift` in the navigator.
- Activate the canvas or the preview button. Changes to text modifiers or layout update instantly.
- The main preview at the bottom of `ScreenplayMainStage.swift` shows the DIN A4 layout.

## How injected blocks appear

`ScriptExecutionEngine` parses the screenplay and inserts tool responses after trigger lines. Each injection is rendered by `DirectiveBlockView`.

To customize them:

1. Edit the `injectedView(for:)` switch in `DirectiveBlockView` to adjust fonts or colors.
2. Extend `handle(_:after:)` in `ScriptExecutionEngine` to insert new block types.

## Adapting fonts and layout

- Modify the `.font` modifier in `ScreenplayMainStage` to change the global appearance.
- Tweak the `LazyVStack` and container padding to adjust margins.
- Add or remove injected blocks by editing your script in `ScriptEditorStageView` and observing how the engine updates the preview.

## Formatting `.fountain` elements

`DirectiveBlockView` maps every parsed `FountainElementType` to a SwiftUI subview.  
Scene headings appear in bold uppercase at the left margin, character cues are
centered, dialogue blocks narrow to around 500 points width, and transitions
align to the right edge. Adjust these small views to fine tune classic
screenplay formatting for each semantic unit.

This workflow lets you iterate quickly in Xcode before committing changes back to the repository.
