# History and Roadmap

*Origin story and future tasks.*

Codex-Deployer began as an experiment to remove brittle CI pipelines and GitHub Actions from the deployment process. It evolved into an always-on, Git-native compiler loop. While it is not a conventional CI tool, the focus on reasoning-driven deployments sets it apart: Codex continuously patches and rebuilds services without external runners.

## Next Steps

See [../roadmap.md](../roadmap.md) for upcoming tasks.
