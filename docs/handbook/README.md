# Codex-Deployer Handbook

The **Codex-Deployer Handbook** collects tutorials, references and design notes
for operating the deployment loop. It exists so new contributors can quickly
understand the tooling, learn how to run it locally and see how each service
fits together.

## Getting Started

The articles in this section show how to set up Codex-Deployer locally and run
basic tests. They also explain where to configure required environment
variables.

- [Managing Environment Variables](../managing_environment_variables.md)
- [Environment Variables Reference](../environment_variables.md)

## Dispatcher Details

Here youâ€™ll find specifics about the dispatcher service itself, including how
it interacts with GitHub pull requests.

- [Dispatcher v2 Overview](../dispatcher_v2.md)
- [Pull Request Workflow](../pull_request_workflow.md)

## Background Reading

These documents capture broader architectural decisions and additional tools
used around the deployment process.

- [Design Pattern Evaluation](../design_patterns.md)
- [Log Aggregation Setup](../log_aggregation.md)
- [Secrets API Proposal](../secrets_api_proposal.md)
- [What is Git?](../what_is_git.md)
- [FountainAI macOS UI Plan](../fountainai_mac_ui_plan.md)

These documents should give you a complete picture of how the dispatcher works,
how to configure it, and how the surrounding services fit together. All guides
reference [`environment_variables.md`](../environment_variables.md) when
describing required settings.
