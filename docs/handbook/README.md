# Codex-Deployer Handbook

Welcome to the early draft of the **Codex-Deployer Handbook**. This folder aggregates the
existing tutorials and reference material for operating the deployment loop.
The goal is to centralize onboarding documentation so new contributors can
locate all relevant guides in one place.

## Table of Contents

### Getting Started
- [Introduction to Codex-Deployer](introduction.md) – start here for core concepts and platform overview
- [Running on macOS with Docker](../mac_docker_tutorial.md)
- [Local Testing on macOS](../mac_local_testing.md)
- [Managing Environment Variables](../managing_environment_variables.md)
- [Environment Variables Reference](../environment_variables.md)

### Dispatcher Details
- [Dispatcher v2 Overview](../dispatcher_v2.md)
- [Pull Request Workflow](../pull_request_workflow.md)

### Background Reading
- [Design Pattern Evaluation](../design_patterns.md)

- [Secrets API Proposal](../secrets_api_proposal.md)
- [What is Git?](../what_is_git.md)
- [FountainAI macOS UI Plan](../fountainai_mac_ui_plan.md)

These documents should give you a complete picture of how the dispatcher works,
how to configure it, and how the surrounding services fit together. All guides
reference [`environment_variables.md`](../environment_variables.md) when
describing required settings.
