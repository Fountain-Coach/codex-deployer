# Time-Saving Test Strategy

A helper script `scripts/run-tests.sh` now bundles the release build and coverage test into a single command. Running this script reduces manual steps and ensures logs are captured for each run.

Usage:
```bash
./scripts/run-tests.sh
```
This executes the build and test sequence with coverage enabled, storing logs under `logs/`.
