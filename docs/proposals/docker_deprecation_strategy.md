# Docker Deprecation Strategy for FountainAI Deployment

The Codex deployer currently relies on Docker images and `docker compose` files to start the Gateway, FountainAI services, and the Typesense server. Moving toward a Swift‚Äënative tooling chain allows us to simplify the runtime environment and remove Docker as a hard dependency.

## Goals
- Ship all services as prebuilt Swift binaries or SPM packages.
- Use `systemd` units on Linux to manage the processes.
- Provide Xcode schemes or launchd plists for macOS and other Apple platforms.
- Keep the workflow consistent with the existing environment variable setup.

## Migration Steps
1. **Build Binaries** ‚Äì Compile each service (`gateway-server`, `planner-server`, `typesense-server`, etc.) with `swift build -c release`. Archive the resulting executables for direct distribution.
2. **Replace Compose Files** ‚Äì Translate each service definition from `docker-compose.yml` into individual `systemd` service files. The sample `fountain-dispatcher.service` under `systemd/` can serve as a template.
3. **Package Typesense** ‚Äì Download the official Typesense release for Linux and macOS. Provide helper scripts in `Scripts/` to launch the server with matching environment variables.
4. **Update Documentation** ‚Äì Revise the macOS guides (`mac_local_testing.md` and `mac_docker_tutorial.md`) to show local builds and systemd or launchd setup instead of Docker containers.
5. **CI Adjustments** ‚Äì Remove the Docker build step in `dispatcher.env` (`DISPATCHER_BUILD_DOCKER`) once all services have direct build instructions.

By gradually phasing out container usage we reduce startup time and simplify production deployments across Linux and macOS. The existing OpenAPI‚Äëdriven code generation remains unchanged.
