# Codex-Deployer First Priority List

The project is gradually expanding from a deployment helper to a semantic maintainer for the entire FountainAI stack. Based on the current state of the repository, the most impactful next steps are:

1. **File watchers & webhooks** – Trigger dispatcher cycles automatically when sources change. This speeds up feedback loops and keeps services in sync.
2. **Visual dashboard** – Surface build logs, test status, and loop metrics through a small web interface.
3. **Improved patch workflow** – Handle merge conflicts and failing patches more gracefully to reduce manual intervention.
4. **TeatroView integration** – Implement the “LLM-First” Typesense GUI and hook it into the existing dispatcher-generated Typesense client.
5. **Documentation hygiene** – Keep environment variables and repo READMEs updated as features evolve.
