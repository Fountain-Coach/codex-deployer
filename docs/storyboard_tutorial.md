# Storyboard DSL Tutorial

The **Storyboard Demo** in `TeatroPlayground` showcases how Codex can help plan UI flows. Launch the app and select *Storyboard Demo* to see a text-based preview generated by `CodexStoryboardPreviewer`.

## Steps

1. **Welcome** ‚Äì an intro screen.
2. **Login** ‚Äì form with two fields.
3. **Processing** ‚Äì brief loading view.
4. **Dashboard** ‚Äì final confirmation.

Each transition is annotated with frame counts so you can experiment with crossfades and tweens. Use the prompt output to refine scenes before implementing real SwiftUI views.
