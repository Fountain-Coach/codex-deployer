Coverage results are recalculated after each test run to monitor progress. The project strives for ever more comprehensive test suites across all modules. Recent additions include unit tests for ``APIClient``. New tests now verify ``URLSessionHTTPClient`` behavior and the ``Supervisor`` process termination logic.
Additional tests now cover ``OpenAPISpec.swiftType`` and the ``camelCased`` string helper. A new ``GatewayServerTests`` suite raises total tests to **27**.
The new ``CertificateManagerTests`` ensure renewal scripts run correctly.
New ``SpecValidatorTests`` and ``ListRecordsRequestTests`` bring the total test count to **31**.
New ``DeleteZoneRequestTests`` ensures zone deletion paths are correct, bringing the total to **32** tests.
The added metrics check raises the suite to **33** tests.
The new ``GetRecordRequestTests`` brings the total test count to **34**.
The added ``PublishingConfigDefaultValues`` test raises the suite to **35** tests.
The new ``TodoEncodingRoundTrip`` test brings the total test count to **36**.
The new ``SecurityRequirementTests`` bring the total test count to **38**.
The new ``HTTPResponseDefaultsTests`` increase the total test count to **40**.
The new ``AsyncHTTPClientDriverTests`` bring the total test count to **41**.
The new ``CreatePrimaryServerRequestTests`` and ``GetPrimaryServerRequestTests`` raise the total test count to **49**.
Additional plugin rewrite and raw data tests raise the total test count to **51**.
The new ``validateZoneFile`` and ``updatePrimaryServer`` request tests raise the total test count to **55**.
The new ``TodoEquality`` and ``TodoDecodingFailsForMissingName`` tests bring the total test count to **57**.
