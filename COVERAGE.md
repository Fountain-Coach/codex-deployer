## Code Coverage Report

### Overall repository coverage

Running `swift test --enable-code-coverage` and analysing with `llvm-cov` produced the following totals:

```
TOTAL                                          31063   28253     9.05%   13773   12229    11.21%   97925   88227     9.90%
```

The repository contains **97,925** executable lines, with **9,698** lines covered (approx. **9.90%** line coverage).

### Repository source coverage

Ignoring third-party packages under `.build/checkouts`, the totals are:

```
TOTAL                                            676     481    28.85%     234     142    39.32%    1543     964    37.52%
```

Within repository sources there are **1,543** lines, with **579** covered, giving **37.52%** line coverage.

## Action Plan

1. **Increase unit tests** for modules with zero coverage such as the API request structs in `PublishingFrontend` and parsing utilities in `FountainCodex`.
2. **Expand integration tests** by spinning up `HTTPKernel` and issuing real HTTP requests against the Gateway and publishing server.
3. **Add end-to-end tests** that launch `FountainAiLauncher`, run the full deployment workflow, and verify outputs and error handling.
4. **Monitor coverage** by re-running `llvm-cov` after each new test suite. Aim to approach 100% coverage across all modules.
