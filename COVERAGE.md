## Code Coverage Report

### Overall repository coverage

Running `swift test --enable-code-coverage` and analysing with `llvm-cov` produced the following totals:

```
TOTAL                                          31315   30821    10.68%   13846 12300    12.54%   98248   87754    10.68%
```

The repository contains **98,248** executable lines, with **10,494** lines covered (approx. **10.68%** line coverage).

### Repository source coverage

Ignoring third-party packages under `.build/checkouts`, the totals are:

```
