```

The repository contains **98,519** executable lines, with **10,710** lines covered (approx. **10.87%** line coverage).

### Repository source coverage

Ignoring third-party packages under `.build/checkouts`, the totals are:

```
TOTAL                                            963     406    57.84%     431   117    72.85%    2172     800    63.17%

Coverage results are recalculated after each test run to monitor progress. The project strives for ever more comprehensive test suites across all modules. Recent additions include unit tests for ``APIClient``. New tests now verify ``URLSessionHTTPClient`` behavior and the ``Supervisor`` process termination logic.
Additional tests now cover ``OpenAPISpec.swiftType`` and the ``camelCased`` string helper. A new ``GatewayServerTests`` suite raises total tests to **27**.
The new ``CertificateManagerTests`` ensure renewal scripts run correctly.
New ``SpecValidatorTests`` and ``ListRecordsRequestTests`` bring the total test count to **31**.
New ``DeleteZoneRequestTests`` ensures zone deletion paths are correct, bringing the total to **32** tests.
The added metrics check raises the suite to **33** tests.
The new ``GetRecordRequestTests`` brings the total test count to **34**.
The added ``PublishingConfigDefaultValues`` test raises the suite to **35** tests.
The new ``TodoEncodingRoundTrip`` test brings the total test count to **36**.
The new ``SecurityRequirementTests`` bring the total test count to **38**.
The new ``HTTPResponseDefaultsTests`` increase the total test count to **40**.
