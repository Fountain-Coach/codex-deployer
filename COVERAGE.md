## Code Coverage Report

### Overall repository coverage

Running `swift test --enable-code-coverage` and analysing with `llvm-cov` produced the following totals:

```
TOTAL                                          31054   28461     8.35%   13766   12408     9.86%   97890   88577     9.51%
```

The repository contains **97,890** executable lines, with **8,857** lines covered (approx. **9.51%** line coverage).

### Repository source coverage

Ignoring third-party packages under `.build/checkouts`, the totals are:

```
TOTAL                                            543     421    22.47%     155     110    29.03%    1224     815    33.42%
```

Within repository sources there are **1,224** lines, with **815** covered, giving **33.42%** line coverage.

Additional tests for `HetznerDNSClient` raise coverage slightly by exercising request headers and query generation.

## Action Plan

1. **Increase unit tests** for modules with zero coverage such as the API request structs in `PublishingFrontend` and parsing utilities in `FountainCodex`.
2. **Expand integration tests** by spinning up `HTTPKernel` and issuing real HTTP requests against the Gateway and publishing server.
3. **Add end-to-end tests** that launch `FountainAiLauncher`, run the full deployment workflow, and verify outputs and error handling.
4. **Monitor coverage** by re-running `llvm-cov` after each new test suite. Aim to approach 100% coverage across all modules.
