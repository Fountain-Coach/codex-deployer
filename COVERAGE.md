## Code Coverage Report

### Overall repository coverage

Running `swift test --enable-code-coverage` and analysing with `llvm-cov` produced the following totals:

```
TOTAL                                          31192   28328     9.18%   13839 12335    10.87%   98196   88284    10.09%
```

The repository contains **98,196** executable lines, with **9,912** lines covered (approx. **10.09%** line coverage).

### Repository source coverage

Ignoring third-party packages under `.build/checkouts`, the totals are:

```
TOTAL                                            416     794    34.38%     0   0    0.00%    1210     794    34.38%
```

Within repository sources there are **1,210** lines, with **416** covered, giving **34.38%** line coverage.

Coverage results are recalculated after each test run to monitor progress. The project strives for ever more comprehensive test suites across all modules.
