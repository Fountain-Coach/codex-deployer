## Code Coverage Report

### Overall repository coverage

Running `swift test --enable-code-coverage` and analysing with `llvm-cov` produced the following totals:

```
TOTAL                                          31054   28461     8.35%   13766  12408     9.86%   97890   88577     9.51%
```

The repository contains **97,890** executable lines, with **8,857** lines covered (approx. **9.51%** line coverage).

### Repository source coverage

Ignoring third-party packages under `.build/checkouts`, the totals are:

```
TOTAL                                            543     421    22.47%     155   110    29.03%    1224     815    33.42%
```

Within repository sources there are **1,224** lines, with **815** covered, giving **33.42%** line coverage.

Coverage results are recalculated after each test run to monitor progress. The project strives for ever more comprehensive test suites across all modules.
