# MIDI2 Web Publishing Bridge Plugin

This concept sketches a Gateway plugin that connects the static Publishing Frontend to the existing `SSEOverMIDI` library. The plugin would:

- **Expose SSE endpoints** at the gateway (e.g., `/events`), wrapping HTTP responses with `DefaultSseSender` for browsers.
- **Translate** each SSE envelope to and from MIDI 2.0 messages using the `SSEOverMIDI` sender/receiver protocols.
- **Register** alongside other `GatewayPlugin` implementations so the Publishing Frontend can stream reasoning events over either HTTP SSE or MIDI transports without altering its static-file design.

By bridging these components, web clients gain transparent reasoning streams while external MIDI devices receive the same data via MIDI 2.0.
